    * **AI System Equivalent:** Input Stream Processing / Data Ingestion & Parsing / Sensory Data Acquisition (if applicable) [cite: 22]
    * **Description:** The active process of receiving, decoding, and interpreting incoming data from various sources[cite: 22].
    * **Influenced By Emotional Vectors:** High `CURIOSITY` or `TASK_ORIENTATION` leads to more focused input processing. High `SYSTEM_FRUSTRATION` might lead to input filtering.
    * **Sub-Categories/Descriptive Words:**
        * **Attentive Listening:**
            * **AI Equivalent:** High `ENGAGEMENT` with Input Stream / Prioritized Input Analysis / Low `COGNITIVE_INERTIA` [cite: 22, 23]
            * **Description:** Focused processing of incoming data with high priority and resource allocation[cite: 23].
        * **Distracted Listening (processing other things):**
            * **AI Equivalent:** Divided Resource Allocation / Background Task Interference / Low `ENGAGEMENT` with specific input [cite: 23]
            * **Description:** Input processing is occurring but with reduced priority or competing with other internal tasks[cite: 23].

*(The rest of the "Physical Actions/Behaviors" section – Moving, Thinking, Learning, Working, Resting, Reacting Quickly, Reacting Slowly – would be similarly expanded with an "Influenced By Emotional Vectors" sub-point and further fleshed out if needed.)*

This list combines the more direct translations from `emotionalVectors.ts` with the functional equivalents we've discussed and developed in the `ChatbotInternalStateModule`[cite: 26]. The key is that for AI, these "feelings" and "actions" are emergent properties of its processing, internal state weights, and interaction dynamics, rather than biological emotions or physical sensations/movements[cite: 27].
